# agenda

This code implements a contact management system in Python. It allows the user to:

✅ Add contacts with phone numbers, emails, and addresses.
✅ Edit contacts, changing names or contact details.
✅ Delete contacts with confirmation.
✅ View contacts individually or the entire agenda.
✅ Export and import contacts in TXT and JSON files.
✅ Interactive menu for easy navigation through the system.

The code uses a dictionary (agenda) to store contacts and their information, along with various functions to manipulate and display the data.
